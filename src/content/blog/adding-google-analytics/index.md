<a href="https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-to-connect-your-gatsby-js-landing-page-to-google-analytics-and-deploy-to-netlify-step-by-step-8352467583df">Today I came across an article on how to connect Google Analytics</a> to your Gatsby site using dotenv. I found this resource to be super helpful and easy to follow.

You clearly don't want to paste your Google Analytics tracking info in your build code. So dotenv is a great way to securely connect your data.

I also recently just began to use Netlify, but I am baffled at how easy it is to get builds up and running on the web using this tool.
